# jQuery UI Bootstrap theme
The incredible styles of Twitter Bootstrap, now for jQuery UI!

## Examples
[http://gustavohenke.github.com/jquery-ui-bootstrap](http://gustavohenke.github.com/jquery-ui-bootstrap)

## Installation
Install it with ease via [Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/):

```
bower install jquery-ui-bootstrap
```
or, you may also simply [download it](https://github.com/gustavohenke/jquery-ui-bootstrap/archive/master.zip)!

Then, you only have to include the CSS files:
* `jquery.ui.theme.css`
* `jquery.ui.theme.font-awesome.css` _(optional, if you use FontAwesome only)_

## Why?
I knew about [Addy Osmani](https://github.com/addyosmani/jquery-ui-bootstrap/)'s try with this before starting my own repository. However, he looks compromised with other things, and his styles are outdated. 
So, I asked myself: _why not try it?_ It would be incredible to make it happen for Bootstrap 2!

Finally, I hope you enjoy my work!
